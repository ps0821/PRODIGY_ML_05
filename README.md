# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

This project develops a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The goal is to enable users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [Food-101](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101) dataset on Kaggle.

## Introduction
Keeping track of dietary intake is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This project aims to develop a model that can automatically recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. Users can use this model to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## Dataset
The Food-101 dataset used in this project contains images of 101 different food categories. Each category consists of 1,000 images, resulting in a total of 101,000 images. The dataset is labeled with the corresponding food categories, allowing for supervised learning.

You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV (cv2)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras opencv-python

<h1><b>Usage</b></h1>

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-recognition.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

cd food-recognition

**Run the food_recognition.py script to train the model and classify food items:**

python food_recognition.py

<h1><b>Model</b></h1>

The food recognition and calorie estimation model is implemented using deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The key steps involved are:

**Data Preprocessing:** Preprocessing the images (e.g., resizing, normalization) and preparing the dataset for training.

**Model Training:** Training a CNN model on the preprocessed image data to classify different food items.

**Calorie Estimation:** Estimating the calorie content of recognized food items based on their nutritional information and portion size.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy and calorie estimation error.

<h1><b>Results</b></h1>

The performance of the food recognition and calorie estimation model is evaluated based on its accuracy in classifying different food items and estimating their calorie content. Visualizations such as confusion matrix and calorie estimation error plots are used to analyze the results.
